# Python-Course-Midudev  🐍

This repository is my **Python learning portfolio**, built as a long-term course and structured roadmap.

It contains my progress from fundamentals to practical topics, including code examples, exercises, and mini projects. The purpose is to keep a clean, well-organized reference that demonstrates consistent learning, hands-on practice, and improvement over time.
